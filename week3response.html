            <p>I find this statement very helpful for me at least. When building websites, I often take it as a single project where there will be an end product. This statement “Websites are living, temporal spaces” acts as a reminder for me to embrace the idea that the web is never a finished product but a constantly evolving project. The website is a space that gives you the potential for personal growth, a canvas for your creative ideas, and a hub for connecting with a global audience.
